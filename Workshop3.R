#basic lopping introduction#
#what is a loop# 
#using loop with for function#
for(i in 1:5){  # create a for loop that runs 5 times (1 to 5)
  print(i)      # each time the for loop runs, print the value of i
}
#this shows that the loop runs through the vector of 1-5#
#iterable is called i#
x <- 0          # make a new scalar called x with a value of 0

for(i in 1:10){ # create a for loop that runs 10 times (1 to 10)
  x <- x + i    # within our for loop we are adding the value of i to the value of x
}

print(x)        # print x
#Here we have created a variable called x that has a value of 0. x therefore has the value of i added to each it time the loop runs, meaning that the value of i becomes 55 from 0 (0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10).#
#practice#
x <- 6          # make a new scalar called x with a value of 0

for(i in 2:22){ # create a for loop that runs 10 times (1 to 10)
  x <- x + i    # within our for loop we are adding the value of i to the value of x
}

print(x)

#basic loop questions 2.3#
#part 1 done on other r sheet#
#2) Try changing the numbers in the for() function (1:10) to numbers of your choosing multiple times. What do you see?#
for(i in 1:25){  # create a for loop that runs 5 times (1 to 5)
  print(i)      # each time the for loop runs, print the value of i
}
for(i in 2:80){  # create a for loop that runs 5 times (1 to 5)
  print(i)      # each time the for loop runs, print the value of i
}
#3) Try changing the the name of i in the for() function to a name of your choosing and get the loop to run.#
for(n in 1:5){  # create a for loop that runs 5 times (1 to 5)
  print(n)      # each time the for loop runs, print the value of i
}
#4) Make a for loop that loops over the numbers 10 to 20, and prints the square of each.#
for(a in 10:20){  # create a for loop that runs 5 times (1 to 5)
  print(a^2)      # each time the for loop runs, print the value of i
}
# Make your own for loop that runs 5 times and each time it runs takes a starting number of your choice and divides it by 13, before overwriting the original starting value. It should print the new value each time.#
for(i in 3:7){  # create a for loop that runs 5 times (1 to 5)
  i <- i/13      # each time the for loop runs, print the value of i
  print(i)
}
x <- 111 # this can be any number of your choosing
for (i in 1:5) {
  x <- x / 13
  print(x)
}

x <- 21 # this can be any number of your choosing
for (i in 1:5) {
  x <- x / 13
  print(x)
}
#this shows how to overwrite#
a <- 3
a <- a + 2
a
#6) Make your own for loop that takes two numeric scalars (your choice), adds them together, and prints their summed value to the power of your iterator (2 in the first loop, 3 in the second, etc. up to 6).#
x <- 111 # this can be any number of your choosing
y <- 21 # this can be any number of your choosing
for (i in 2:6) {
  z <- x + y
  print(z ^ i)
}
